			<h2> SUNY Schools are Becoming More Diverse: But is it Enough?</h2>
			<h4> SUNY schools continually express their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, yet the racial idenity of students does not reflect statewide diversity. </h4>

			<h3>Growing Diversity</h3>

<p>Throughout history, higher education opportunities were only available to the most affluent of a community, those in which were deemed the “elite.”And, historically, these people were white men. However, because of societal and political changes, this trend began to shift. But, by how much? 
</p>

<p>In 1961, John F. Kennedy first used the phrase “affirmative action” in Executive Order 10925. This order, created by the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, referred to measures designed to achieve non-discrimination in the workforce. </p> 

<p>By the late 1960s, affirmative action was used by higher education institutions. This was done in hopes of admitting more students of color as these institutions recognized they had historically been excluded from higher education opportunities. 
 </p> 

<p>As decades went on, having a diverse and inclusive university became a major goal for universities. Hopes were that student admittance would eventually reflect the diversity of the state. This would mean all students, no matter what background, would be given the same opportunities.
 </p>

<p>The State University of New York, the largest public university system in the United States, is committed to diversity and inclusion. Its previous chancellor, Nancy L. Zimpher, explained the importance of diverse campuses in New York.  </p>

<p>“As a public university system serving one of the nation’s most diverse states, it is essential that SUNY adapt to the evolving needs of all students,” she said. 
 </p>

 <p>SUNY has acknowledged the diversity of New York state and has committed to the cause of encouraging a more racially diverse campus. In 2002, 70.4% of students at SUNY schools were white, and by 2022 this number shrunk to 52.5%. This change occurred because of efforts made by universities to increase diversity.</p>

 <p>However, it is important to acknowledge if enough progress has been made.</p>

			<h3>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Plans</h3>
			<p>
				SUNY has acknowledged these disparities and has created DEI plans to mend the issues. They have acknowledged that the most underrepresented group at their universities are Black and Hispanic/LatinX students. 
			</p>
			<div class="list">
				<h5>
				SUNY schools have said they want to fix this and have since created a 25-point DEI plan. Some main points in their plan include:</h5>
				<ul> 
					<li>An assessment of racial equity gaps.</li>
					<li>Curriculum focused on racial equity.</li> 
					<li>Increased SUNY diversity hiring.</li>
					<li>Improving campus life for the broad diversity of students.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Mary Grace Almandrez, VP of Diversity and Inclusion at Syracuse University, explained that their office’s main goal involves recruitment and retention. In terms of recruitment she explained that one change SU made, which SUNY schools also made, was making their schools test optional. 
			</p>
			<p>
				“What we found was that when we made the admissions test optional, in terms of turning in your scores, the numbers of students of color applicants increased. And what we know is when we have a larger pool to draw from, we're likely to yield a more diverse class,” she said. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Almandrez also said they take into account where Syracuse is located and try to make opportunities for those living in the area, which is something that current SUNY Chancellor also takes into consideration.
				</p>

			<p>
			“We are looking into how we’re drawing from Syracuse as well. How do we make this university a viable option for those who live in the community? We don’t just want to be a campus on the hill. We work with local schools so that people can see Syracuse as a place where they can get their degree,” she said. </p>

			<p>
			Another main goal of SU, Almandrez explained, was educating the current students on campus. This has been done with the First Year Seminar requirement, which explains the importance of diversity and helps adjust first-year students to a larger community. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Similarly, one plan that has been brought to fruition at SUNY schools is incorporating diversity in General Education requirements. Beginning in the Fall 2023 semester, SUNY began requiring students to complete a “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Social Justice (DEISJ)” course.
		</p>

		<p>
			The hope for the course is to “describe the historical and contemporary societal factors that shape the development of individual and group identity involving race, class and gender.” John King, current Chancellor, explained that this course is important because it recognizes and celebrates diversity by embedding it into the foundations of SUNY schools.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, there are many critics of this new requirement. The Post said that this class forces students to be defined by the color of their skin. Nicholas Giordano, a political science professor at SUNY’s Suffolk Community College said, “This is nuts. SUNY is one of the best university systems in the country. Why are they doing this?”
		</p>

		<p>
			Almandrez, in response to criticism, explained how college is a unique experience in which students can be exposed, sometimes for the first time, to complicated world problems in a safe environment.
		</p>

		<p>
			“There are systems that don't allow everyone to be able to thrive and everyone to be able to have a living wage to feed their families. So colleges and universities allow students to grapple with really complicated issues with faculty who are the best in their field. And with staff and administrators who care deeply about students,” she said.

			<h3>Why Campus Life is Important</h3>
			<p>A main factor in student retention is campus life. It is important for students to feel welcomed and included in a community, and the ability to achieve this directly relates to a student’s happiness and want to continue pursuing education there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				College loneliness is a real issue young people face today. In a study included in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.2190/A465-356M-7652-783R">The Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory & Practice </a> , it was found that students involved in a supportive and welcoming peer environment were less likely to be lonely and more likely to make academic persistent decisions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				“Intuitively, loneliness is related to social support. It was found that lonely people interacted less with friends and family than did non-lonely people and that, for some, the less social support one has the greater their feelings of loneliness. It was found that low levels of social support among college students during the middle of the semester were predictive of  later feelings of loneliness at the end of the same semester.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Almandrez explained the efforts that colleges are making to encourage an inclusive environment. 
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s important to create affinity spaces where students will feel comfortable. For some it may be the student center, for others the gym. Some it may be Greek life. It's all about: how can we create smaller communities within a large community? Regardless of where you find your home, it’s important [students] feel welcomed, feel included, and feel important,” she said.
			</p>
			<h5> 
				It is evident that SUNY schools have made efforts to increase racial diversity as shown in the data from 2002-2022. In addition, they have also recognized that its racial diversity is not reflective of statewide diversity. To combat that issue, they have created a plan, some of which has been brought to fruition, to encourge both recruitment and retention of a diverse student body.
